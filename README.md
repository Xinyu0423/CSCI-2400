3. Please **DO NOT** email me with questions about my/your assignemnts, you should finish your work by yourself. I won't reply to those emails. (The only reason you're emailing me should be that some of my content violates your course content).
4. Some parts of the assignment may be wrong because I don't remember each assignment grades, so I put my grades for this course for your reference. Again please just have it for inspiration and **DO NOT** use it for plagiarism.
5. The predecessors planted trees, and the later generations enjoyed the shade. I also got a lot of inspiration from other people's repo in the process of learning, so I uploaded my course material, I hope these content will help you.
